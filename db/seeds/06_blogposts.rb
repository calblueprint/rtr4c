    post:  "The San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center is thrilled to announce today that local nonprofit organization, Rooms That Rock 4 Chemo (RTR4C), has completed the redesigning of five infusion rooms, hallway, the nurses’ break room and the waiting room within the chemotherapy unit at The General. One of the rooms has been transformed in honor of six-year-old Nicholas “Nicky” Sommerfield, who passed away here after being struck by a car. His father spent much time at SF General mending a broken body, spirit and heart. On the 10th anniversary of his death, RTR4C is giving Nicky’s family a way to transform a tragedy into something positive and healing for the community. A dedication ceremony will be held on Friday, November 15, 2013 at 5p.m. to celebrate the Nicky’s life and the newly renovated chemo unit.")

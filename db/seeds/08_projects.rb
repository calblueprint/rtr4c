  title: 'Mammoth Hospital',
  description: 'Mammoth Hospital was in need of revamping a large chemotherapy community room that had 10 chairs to provide 13,000 patient visits per year. Our RTR4C Southern California Designer, Nicole Cavanaugh came to their aid with a full crew and all needed supplies to create a healing loving room with a FIREPLACE! They open their doors to all that need chemotherapy. It went from drab and average to fabulous, amazing, cozy and warm. A special thank you to Enterprise Car Rental who donated a 4WD/SUV for the snowy trip to Mammoth and to Erica Wells, Chemo Nurse Manager at Mammoth Hospital who added all these details to her already busy schedule. You all rock!',
